Hunter -- A Free Alternative to Gatherer

At present, Hunter is a simple Python script that turns a flat Oracle test file
into a SQLite databse.  It's fairly crude at this time and still needs all
kinds of testing.  It *works*, but it's only useful to developers right now;
so if you need a database of cards and you're comfortable with searching
it on the command line with SQL queries, go for it.

Otherwise, watch this space for future developments.

* cherrypy interface (experimental branch)
A very simple (and butt-ugly) query frontend is implemented in 
'querytest.py'.  Simply run it and then point your web browser to

http://localhost:8080/raw_query?query=

And type your query at the end.

This is nothing more than the groundwork for a later application of the
database program.
