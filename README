Hunter -- A MTG card database program.

At present, Hunter is a simple Python script that turns a flat Oracle text file
into a SQLite databse.  It's fairly crude at this time and still needs all
kinds of testing.  It *works*, but it's only useful to developers right now;
so if you need a database of cards and you're comfortable with searching
it on the command line with SQL queries, go for it.

Otherwise, watch this space for future developments.
