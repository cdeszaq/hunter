Notes on collector numbers:

- Officially, the numbering is done first by color and then by name.
    - Color order:
        Colorless (non-artifact)
        White
        Blue
        Black
        Red
        Green
        Multicolored
        Hybrid
        Artifact
        Land
    - Hybrid cards may be numbered differently in Lorwyn as opposed to 
      a standard order
    - Alara Reborn is all multicolored and uses a different numbering scheme.
      So far as I can tell, the two-colored section is much like any other set
      where the first color clockwise indicates where it belongs.
    - Cross-color cards (and three-color cards) are ordered differently also.

- Sets before a certain point don't have thier own official numbers. 
	- As it turns out, there's a couple ways that they are assigned:
		- On Gatherer, they are simply numbered in alphabetical order
		- On magiccards.info, they're numbered by color, then by name.  
          Note that it uses the BUGRW color order.

- Some cards have multiple artwork.
    - Basic lands have multiple art, but each gets their own collector number.
    - Multiple artworks for cards basically stopped around Alliances block, and
      thus before collector numbers.
    - One counterexample; one of the Kamigawa sets had a legend called "Brothers"
      something that used "a" and "b" numbers for artwork (ie: 184a and 184b).
      This is about as close to an official policy on this matter.
    - There does not seem to be any standard for ordering different artworks
      Not by artist, and basic lands are similar enough (often by the same
      artist, too).

- Split cards and flip cards
    - The full version of split cards do exist within the Oracle file.
    - Each half of the split card also has its own entry, clearly marked.
    - Inverse parts of flip cards are also clearly marked.
