Notes on collector numbers:

- Officially, the numbering is done first by color and then by name.
    - Color order:
        Colorless (non-artifact)
        White
        Blue
        Black
        Red
        Green
        Multicolored
        Hybrid
        Artifact
        Land
    - Hybrid cards may be numbered differently in Lorwyn as opposed to 
      a standard order
      (This has been handled)

    - Alara Reborn is all multicolored and uses a different numbering scheme.
      So far as I can tell, the two-colored section is much like any other set
      where the first color clockwise indicates where it belongs.
      (This has been handled)

    - Cross-color cards (and three-color cards) are ordered differently also.
      (This has been handled)

- Sets before a certain point don't have thier own official numbers. 
	- As it turns out, there's a couple ways that they are assigned:
		- On Gatherer, they are simply numbered in alphabetical order
		- On magiccards.info, they're numbered by color, then by name.  
          Note that it uses the BUGRW color order.
    ( Still undecided as to how this should best be resolved)

- Some cards have multiple artwork.
    - Basic lands have multiple art, but each gets their own collector number.
    - Multiple artworks for cards basically stopped around Alliances block, and
      thus before collector numbers.
    - One counterexample; one of the Kamigawa sets had a legend called "Brothers"
      something that used "a" and "b" numbers for artwork (ie: 184a and 184b).
      This is about as close to an official policy on this matter.
    - There does not seem to be any standard for ordering different artworks
      Not by artist, and basic lands are similar enough (often by the same
      artist, too).

- Split cards and flip cards
    - The full version of split cards do exist within the Oracle file.
    - Each half of the split card also has its own entry, clearly marked.
    - Inverse parts of flip cards are also clearly marked.
    ( These have been handled; reverse sides of double-faced/flip cards and
    the single portions of invasion-era split cards are marked as "virtual"
    and this aren't assigned collector numbers. )

- Timeshifted cards
    - Time Spiral has these cards in their own special rarity.
    - Planar Chaos and Future Sight have their own style of timeshifted cards
      that are incorporated in the set.  The only way to handle these will be
      with their own special lists.
